# Reflection
 Project goals include using technologies, learning up until this point and still familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to have live updates of sports ,considering cricket as one of the most famous and high-in-demand sport I chose it.Cricbuzz is an Indian cricket news website owned by Times Internet. It features, news, articles and live coverage of cricket matches including videos, text commentary, player stats and team rankings.I am trying to add some new features to it.

As a beginner this my first project, the main challenges I ran into was how to begin with the project,how to divide it into sections and after a lot of research I was able to understand and work on the project.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are HTML and CSS. I decided to create a HTML-CSS website. In the next iteration I plan on adding a dialog flow to help users get more engaged on the web application.
